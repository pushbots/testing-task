## Tester Challenge
Clone the repo and run ```npm install``` before you start

**NodeJs** is  required to run this project [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
## Backend Integration Test
Using the following endpoint: http://localhost:3000/hotels 

Note: run ```npm start``` to start the json server first

Write an integration tests with jest for these endpoints:

        { "from": "25-10-2020", "to": "15-11-2020" },
        { "from": "10-12-2020", "to": "15-12-2020" }
      ]

```json
  {
    "name":"new Elmandra",
    "city": "giza",

        { "from": "10-10-2020", "to": "15-10-2020" },
        { "from": "25-10-2020", "to": "15-11-2020" },
        { "from": "10-12-2020", "to": "15-12-2020" }
      ]
  }
  ``` 
- [ ] DELETE /hotels/:hotelID -> should delete hotel from the list

## End to End test

Using the following url : http://hotelsearch.surge.sh

Open it should search for hotel available from start date to the end date 

Write an E2E tests with cypress to test the following actions:

### Search page (/):

- [ ] when you open the home page show a place holder till the data is loaded
- [ ] when the data loaded should show a 2 date pickers and 2 button
- [ ] when you click any of "To" or "From" it should open a date picker
- [ ] when you choose a date from the picker it should update the fields
- [ ] when you click clear it should clear the two feilds
- [ ] when you click seach and feilds are empty should display validtion error on each feild
- [ ] when you click seach and feilds are not empty should go to result page
 
### Search Result page (/result):

- [ ] when you open result page directly from url it should show empty result and a link to search page
- [ ] when you open it from the search page you there is no result should also show empty result with link
- [ ] when you open it from the search page with result it should show hotels card list
- [ ] when you type in filter by name field it should filter the cards by name
- [ ] when you change price slider it should filter the cards by price
- [ ] when you click sort by name it should sort the cards by name
- [ ] when you click sort by price it should filter the cards by price

### Note: these are the valid cases make sure to cover invalid case as well

## Test Enviroment

Test env is already setuped with jest, axois, cypress

```
  __tests__/
    hotelsApi.test.js --> write you api tests here
  cypress/
    ingeration/
      searchPage.spec.js --> write search e2e test here
      searchPage.spec.js --> write search result e2e test here
```
## Running the tests

```npm run test``` to run jest test runner (api test cases)

```npm run e2e``` to run cypress test cases (E2E)

## Conditions
- You should consume the api endpoint mentioned and not use it as internal json file
- You should write api ingeration tests with jest
- You should write E2E tests with cypress
- You should write a good testing report

## What we are looking for

- **Simple, clear, readable code** How well structured it is? Clear separation of concerns? Can anyone just look at it and get the idea to
what is being done? Does it follow any standards?
- **Correctness** Does the your tests cover all valid and invalid cases? Can you find bugs or trivial flaws?
- **Bug resport** Does your test/bug report is well structured and deliver it's purpose?
